# Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post
Creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own.

The purpose of this project is to show off your technical skills, but more importantly for you to begin putting together a portfolio that shows your ability to effectively communicate technical results. Your technical skills will be built up as the program progresses, but for this project the main focus should be on communicating effectively the results of your analysis.

# Your blog must provide the following:
A clear and engaging title and image.
Your questions of interest.
Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.

What's the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economical?
What's the age distribution like? How is it related to player's overall rating?
How is a player's skils set influence his potential? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills'
